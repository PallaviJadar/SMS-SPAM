Sure! Below is a template for your `README.md` file based on your project **SMS Spam Classifier**:

```markdown
# SMS Spam Classifier

## Description
The **SMS Spam Classifier** is a machine learning project designed to detect spam messages in SMS texts. It uses a collection of labeled SMS messages to train a classification model that can predict whether a given SMS is spam or not. The project aims to help filter out unwanted spam messages in mobile and messaging applications.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

   First, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PallaviJadar/SMS-SPAM.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd SMS-SPAM
   ```

3. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   - If you are using Python 3, you can create a virtual environment using:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - **Windows:**  
       ```bash
       venv\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - **Mac/Linux:**  
       ```bash
       source venv/bin/activate
       ```

4. **Install the required dependencies:**

   Install the required libraries from the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Train the Model:**
   To train the spam classifier, run the following Python script:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

   This will train the model using a dataset of SMS messages and save the trained model to a file.

2. **Make Predictions:**
   Once the model is trained, you can use it to classify new SMS messages. To do so, run the `predict.py` script and pass an SMS message as input:
   ```bash
   python predict.py "Your message here"
   ```

   The model will output whether the message is classified as **spam** or **ham** (non-spam).
